#Brains blood weight

Mental models are how you think about the world. Some are very useful to me, like cynefin, lean, Wardley maps, TDD, DDD, John Cutler's product management view...
Some are too simplistic to be applicable in a realistic context, like the test pyramid, scrum, SAFe, or the SOLID principles.
Simplistic models are useful for talking and giving an entry point into a subject matter, but not as a guideline to take decisions in most concrete situations.

You may notice that the models that are useful to me are simple, for most of them.
They are not simplistic, though.
They reflect the complexity of the world. They are difficult to understand and apply.

I can feel it when a model is a better fit for a given situation.
Take scrum and lean, for example.
I spent years understanding eath of them.
Both are difficult. Both were useful to me, to help me unlearn things.
However, scrum now feels like trying to horseshoe reality into an arbitrary framework.
Lean, on the other hand, feels like it better encompasses the uncertainty and diversity of situations, yet giving guidelines to better adapt to these situations.
I can feel my brains firing less "feels akward" alerts when using lean, thus decreasing the blood weight in my head.

Your mental models are your current grid for understanding the world.
They are often based on someone else's mental model, and you often refer to them using the same name, even though you might have a different understanding of the same concept.
For example, my understanding of cynefin is probably different than Dave Snowden's or Liz Kheog's. Still, we're using the same word.
If you view your comprehension of a model as a simplistic one-dimensional value, you can consider that I understand a lot less of cynefin that Dave Snowden (you wouldn't take much risk).
You can thus consider I'm on my way to understanding cynefin.
During this process, I adapt my existing mental models to fit my new view of the world.
To some extent, I unlearn my existing mental models to adopt a new one in the family.

Unlearning happens all the time. There are a few fundamental limitations that make humanity what it is.
Our lifespan and the weak points of our body (and now our Earth), and the amount of info we can process in our brains.
In order to make sense of the world, we reduce its complexity to a few simple rules.
This is what a mental model is: a simplification of the world.
This is why all models are wrong, but some are useful.
Anyway, when we add new rules, we need to get rid, or factor in, older ones.
This is unlearning. It is necessary, it is a continuous process, and it feels good by decreasing your brains blood weight.
You don't want to become your grumpy old uncle, always complaining about how the world was better back in the days.
Living in a world that doesn't fit your mental models makes you fill in the gap.
Filling in the increases your brains blood weight.
Brains blood weight makes you tired and grumpy.

As you can see, in this article, I simplified the world of mental models in order to make sense of them.
Is this mental model of mental models simplistic? So far it doesn't feel so to me.
It might become so, when I encounter more concrete situations that don't fit this model, and that I need to make sense of.
Is it useful to adapt my mental models to real life? Definitely.
Is it helpful for real life situations? I feel it helps me learn new things, so yes.
